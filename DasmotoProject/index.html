Issues:
  1. Had trouble with the Chrome dev tool finsing how to search though bootstrap
    a. Yes i ussed your template for CSS but wanted to test myself by "hunting" for it through the code
  2. Had trouble linking the "pattern" image with localhost, ended up using URL in the end
  would have liked to use localhost image but still worked in the end
  3. Other then that finding out the css code specifications in colors and background colors was dificult
  in the beggining and a little confusing.
  4. Over all loved this project please give me feedback, be honest
